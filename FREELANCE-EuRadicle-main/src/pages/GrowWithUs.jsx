Even during my internship, I never felt like I was “just an intern.” My ideas were heard, my suggestions were considered, and I was included in real discussions. The team is very open and supportive, which made it easy for me to learn and try new things without being afraid of making mistakes. With the guidance and encouragement, I received, I slowly moved from just learning to actually taking ownership of my work. Because of that trust and support, becoming a full-time team member felt like a natural step, and it continues to motivate me to grow and do better every day.",

During this phase, I worked closely with the leadership and operations teams, supporting financial processes, compliance, vendor coordination, documentation, and day-to-day administrative activities that ensured smooth organizational functioning. This holistic experience helped me understand how financial discipline, structured processes, and efficient administration together enable seamless client delivery and sustainable growth, laying a strong foundation for my professional development and eventually evolving into a full-time role where I continue to strengthen and streamline both finance and administrative operations across the organization.",

From day one, I was trusted with real projects, real clients, and meaningful impact, never treated as “just an intern.” The vibrant, collaborative culture encouraged creativity and pushed me to think beyond the obvious, while also offering flexibility and genuine support as I balanced academics. Working on innovation-driven projects expanded my perspective across strategy, creativity, and solution design, which eventually led to my transition into a Senior Associate – Content Development & Solutioning. Today, I design research-backed capability programs that solve complex talent challenges for large organizations. At EuRadicle, early talent isn’t just managed it’s mentored, empowered, and accelerated.",
